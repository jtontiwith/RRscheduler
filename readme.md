Responsibiliy&Rewards Scheduler is light weight app that helps you schedule your daily reponsibilities and curates rewards in the form of local activities pulled from from Meetup and Eventbrite. No sign up or login required, just download your schedule when done.

## Purpose

> You have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannize yourself...

-Jordan Peterson 

Sometimes task lists can get a little tyrannical. You end up writing a long list of todos without specifying how you are going to reward yourself for doing them. You can't tyrannize yourself into doing all your *shoulds* without negotiating with yourself (i.e. rewarding yourself). Life/human psychology just doesn't work that way. Thus, R&R Scheduler helps users plan their daily responsibilities in the context of responsibilities AND rewards for optimal behavior.
