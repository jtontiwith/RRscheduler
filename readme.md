# Responsibility&Rewards Scheduler 

Responsibility&Rewards Scheduler is light weight app that helps you schedule your daily responsibilities and curates rewards in the form of local activities pulled from Meetup and Eventbrite. There's no signup or login required, just download your schedule when finished.

## Purpose 

>You have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannize yourself.

-Jordan Peterson 

Sometimes task lists can get a little tyrannical. You end up writing a long list of todos without specifying how you are going to reward yourself for doing them. You can't tyrannize yourself into doing all your *shoulds* without negotiating with yourself (i.e. rewarding yourself). R&R Scheduler helps users plan their daily responsibilities in the context of responsibilities AND rewards for optimal behavior.
